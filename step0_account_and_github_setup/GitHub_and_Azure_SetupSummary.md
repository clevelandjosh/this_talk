# GitHub and Azure Setup Summary

## Infrastructure Components Created

### Service Principals
1. **Terraform State Manager**
   - Purpose: Manages Terraform state storage
   - Permissions: Storage Blob Data Contributor
   - Scope: Limited to state storage account

2. **Network Infrastructure Manager**
   - Purpose: Manages networking resources
   - Permissions: Network Infrastructure Contributor (Custom Role)
   - Managed Resources: VNets, NSGs, Load Balancers, Firewalls

3. **AI Foundry Manager**
   - Purpose: Manages AI infrastructure
   - Permissions: AI Foundry Contributor (Custom Role)
   - Scope: AI-specific resources

4. **AKS Manager**
   - Purpose: Manages Kubernetes services
   - Permissions: AKS Contributor + Network Contributor
   - Scope: AKS Resource Group
   - Additional Access: AKS VNet, Load Balancers

5. **VM Image Builder**
   - Purpose: Manages VM image creation
   - Permissions: VM Image Builder Contributor (Custom Role)
   - Scope: VM Resource Group
   - Managed Resources: VMs, Images, Disks

6. **Resource Group Manager**
   - Purpose: General resource group management
   - Permissions: Network Contributor
   - Scope: Subscription-level resource groups

### Resource Groups Created
1. **TF State Resource Group**
   - Purpose: Stores Terraform state
   - Contents: 
     - Storage Account
     - State Container

2. **VM Workload Resource Group**
   - Purpose: VM-related resources
   - Contents:
     - Virtual Machines
     - VM Images
     - Managed Disks

3. **AKS Workload Resource Group**
   - Purpose: Kubernetes resources
   - Contents:
     - AKS Cluster
     - AKS VNet
     - AKS Load Balancer

### GitHub Integration Components
1. **Environments**
   - Production Environment
   - Destruction Environment (for cleanup)

2. **Secrets Storage**
   - Local: `~/.config/azure-setup/`
     - github-secrets.env
     - service-principals.json
   - GitHub Repository Secrets
     - Service Principal credentials (subset)
     - Configuration values
     - No administrator credentials

### Security Implementation
1. **Credential Management**
   - Administrator credentials stored locally only
   - Service Principal credentials split between local and GitHub
   - Secure file permissions (700) on local secret directory

2. **Access Control**
   - Least privilege principle
   - Resource-group scoped permissions
   - Custom roles for specific needs

### Setup Script Features
1. **OS Detection**
   - Supports MacOS and Linux
   - Adapts package manager commands

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Required tools: az, gh, jq
   - Automatic dependency checking
   - Package manager-specific installation

3. **User Interface**
   - Interactive prompts
   - Default values support
   - Automatic subscription detection
   - Progress indicators and color coding

4. **Validation**
   - Input validation
   - Authentication checks
   - Resource existence verification
   - Permission validation

## Usage Context
This setup creates a complete CI/CD infrastructure for:
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Container orchestration (AKS)
- VM management and image building
- Network infrastructure
- AI/ML workloads

## Common Operations
1. Initial Setup:
   ```bash
   az login
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. Resource Group Access:
   - VM operations in VM_RESOURCE_GROUP
   - AKS operations in AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP
   - State management in TF_STATE_RESOURCE_GROUP

3. GitHub Workflow Usage:
   - Production deployments require environment approval
   - Destruction operations require separate approval
   - Secrets automatically available to workflows

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Rollback capabilities
- Validation before critical operations
- State logging for debugging

## Maintenance Notes
- Service Principal credential rotation needed periodically
- GitHub secrets should be reviewed regularly
- Resource group cleanup requires Destruction environment approval
